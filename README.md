> check if a number is prime

[Is it 1 a prime?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number#Primality_of_one)
Some years ago I created a djembe rhythm generated by prime numbers, and it sounds good if 1 is considered prime. However, the algorithm implemented here defines 1 as a *not prime*.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) do

```bash
npm install prime-number
```

## Usage

As you might expect, you can simply do

```js
import isPrime from 'prime-number'

console.log(isPrime(19)) // true
```

You can also use CommonJS.

```js
const isPrime = require('prime-number')
```

## Benchmarks

Clone this repo and install packages for benchmarks with `--no-save` flag.

```sh
npm install check-prime is-prime --no-save
```

Then run benchmark scripts.

Using this `prime-number` package.

```sh
npm run benchmark:prime-number
Found 8363 primes
Primality benchmark: 7.064ms
```

Using [is-prime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-prime) package.

```sh
npm run benchmark:is-prime
Found 8363 primes
Primality benchmark: 7.045ms
```

Using [check-prime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-prime) package.

```sh
npm run benchmark:check-prime
Found 8363 primes
Primality benchmark: 23.785ms
